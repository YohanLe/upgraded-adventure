    <h1>Childhood Life</h1>
    <div>
        <p> My childhood in a crowded city of  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa">Addis Ababa </a> with deep rooted poverty has two colors. There was an authentic freedom to play around all day everyday. There used to be a river which crossed between the city where all the kids from the community go and swim. The river has strong current and during winter time flash floods fill the river which poses a danger to each of the kids. We used to have someone watch out for our parents and flash floods. There was always a punishment from parents if anyone is found swimming in the river so we always have one kid on the lookout which serves as an informant to let us know if any adult from the community comes near the river so we go hide.Playing soccer was one of my favorite sport there used to be a big field where all kids from the community gather to play soccer by forming a team. That was a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>The other aspect of growing in a crowded city exposes kids to many bad things at the early age. Example - some of my friends started smoking for fun and got lost in it after a few years.now they are all addicted to smoking and drinking. Things we do in front of kids matters and has a direct impact on their life. I witnessed a lot of horror in my life. We used to play soccer on the street since there was no soccer field and lost some of my friends in a car accident so I grew up with 100% freedom which comes with all the risks. I love being free and playing outside, which is always worth the risk for me.</p>
