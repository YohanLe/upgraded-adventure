    <h2 id="two">Coming to America - Iowa state</h2>
    <div>
        <p> Iowa, a Midwestern U.S. state, sits between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Itâ€™s known for its landscape of rolling plains and cornfields. Landmarks in the capital, Des Moines, include the gold-domed, 19th-century State Capitol Building, Pappajohn Sculpture Park and the Des Moines Art Center, noted for its contemporary collections. The city of Cedar Rapids' Museum of Art has paintings by native Iowan Grant Wood <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa"> [Source - Wikipedia]</a>.My adulthood was full of dreams and energy to accomplish and change my life. I grow up seeing poverty and struggles. I believe the one and the only way to success in life is having a good education. I worked hard to get a good education. After graduating college got the chance to find a job and earn money to support myself and my families.Earning money and supporting my families was one of my happiest moment.</p>

        <p> I got the chance to come to America - the land of opportunity. I experienced snow and very cold weather in the USA for the first time. Seeing snow fall from the sky as some kind of magic was a very exciting moment for me. There were so many days that I went outside and stood. While I like the snow the cold weather was brutal it's like a bittersweet experience</p>

    <h2 id="two">Moving to the city of Angeles - Los Angeles</h2>
    <p>My first reaction moving to California - Los angeles city was shocking. California has the best weather that I have ever seen before and the city has lots of nearby beaches within a 30 minutes drive. The only challenge is the crazy traffic jams on every single highway and the expensive house rent price.</p>
