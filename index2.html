    <p> I grew up drinking coffee since middle school. Drinking coffee in Ethiopia serves as one of the ceremonies where all community challenges and ideas are hashed out within the members of the community. Families gather to arrange a wedding ceremony and to mourn the loss of loved ones while having coffee.There is a specific way of making coffee, we first get the coffee bean, roast it, grind it and then boil it. To let the grinded coffee bean powder settle the coffee will let sit for a few minutes then what comes out is very testy and original fresh coffee. </p>
